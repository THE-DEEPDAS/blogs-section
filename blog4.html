      <p>
        Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It's calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares. Companies are categorized as large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap based on their market cap.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Dividend Yield</h4>

      <p>
        Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It's a useful metric for investors seeking regular income from their investments.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)</h4>

      <p>
        The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company's current share price relative to its per-share earnings. It's used to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued compared to its earnings.
      </p>

      <h4>4. Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h4>
      <img src="https://navi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Earnings-Per-Share.jpg" alt="EPS example">
      <p>
        Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's a key indicator of a company's profitability and is often used by investors to gauge financial health.
